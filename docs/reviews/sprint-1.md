# Sprint Review (18 sep 2025) Notes

- Likes the logo and name
- I like the young voters, but journalists and researchers are not our main target area because we want to get people involved within the democracy process and journalists/researchers are already involved with that.
- Put a persona column with the age
- First of all, the teachers of social studies are already involved within politics, so they're not really our target group.
  - Our thought was that the teachers would use this application to get their students more involved with politics.
- Add the above students as persona
  - Don't focus on students who are already in social studies because generally they'll already be involved, maybe focus on e.g. IT students, or high school students
- For the legal risks: Don't worry about it for now. It's going to be a proof of concept, we'll take it into consideration. Data complexity is a serious issue so keep that in mind because the data is complex, but it needs to be displayed easily/simple. Misinformation and abuse of the forum is something that should be taken into consideration but not in the beginning of the project. It's not a must-have, but a should-have. User adoption is a serious problem so that should be our main focus.
- One thing about the (homepage) design: I think both options are nice, the blue is nice, but a colour palette. We have three colours, usually that's a palette. Here you have white, blue and gray; basically just blue. Let's add more colours to make it more distinguishable from other websites.
- What I miss here is a way to filter or search on discussions. For example searching based on tags, this should be something I'd like you to think about. How do we make sure a user can find the post that is relevant to them?
- I want to know what we are going to build. You should be more clear and exact on what is being built in terms of what we are going to be displaying in terms of results. For example, can users click on their favourite area and see the top candidate?

## End of presentation notes

- What I'm still missing here is what are you going to build? We need to come up with concrete functional and non-functional requirements. They should be based on the persona; we start planning on Tuesday so that should be finished by then.
- Interesting thought: How would the Tweede Kamer look like if we only look at the province of Groningen.
- Short follow up meeting on Friday.
- Feedback will be added to DLO based on our meeting on Friday and Tuesday.
- Everything that is shown (personas, requirements, designs) should be available within the GitLab repository.
