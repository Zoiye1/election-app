## 🟢 START - What we will start doing

> _What new things will we start doing? Think about new workflows, tools, habits, or agreements that can help the team._

| Action                                      | Why                                                                                                         | By       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Start creating smaller merge requests       | This creates more overview and is easier to review and merge with main.                                     | Shivanio |
| Start giving more insight on availability   | This creates easier cooperation between team members and a faster work rate as everyone knows availabilities. | Matisse  |
| Start using code comments in sprint reviews | This makes merge request reviews more insightful and helps the team learn from each other's code.           | Zoiye    |
| Start celebrating small successes           | To boost team morale and motivation by recognizing progress, not just completed goals.                      | Batuhan  |

## 🔴 STOP - What we will stop doing

> _What isn't working and should we stop? Think about habits, processes, or behavior that slows down or frustrates the team._

| Action                                                               | Why                                                                                                                                         | By       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Stop making huge vertical slice merge requests                       | To make code reviews faster, more thorough, and easier to understand. Smaller changes mean better feedback and fewer bugs slipping through. | Shivanio |
| Stop assuming others know what you're working on                     | Because transparency prevents blockers and helps the team support each other.                                                               | Matisse  |
| Stop submitting merge requests at the last moment                    | Because rushed reviews miss critical bugs — giving reviewers time prevents big problems.                                                    | Zoiye    |
| Stop going down rabbit holes that aren't related to our sprint work  | To stay focused, deliver what we committed to, and avoid wasting time and energy.                                                           | Batuhan  |

## 🔵 CONTINUE - What we will keep doing

> _What is going well and should we keep doing? Think about successful workflows, good communication, or effective tools._

| Action                                                          | Why it works                                                                  | By       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Continue putting in the effort and staying committed as a team  | To keep delivering quality work and maintain our positive momentum.           | Shivanio |
| Continue using merge request templates with clear summaries     | To help reviewers understand changes quickly and give better feedback.        | Matisse  |
| Continue keeping up the positive team spirit                    | Because a good atmosphere makes collaboration easier and work more enjoyable. | Zoiye    |
| Continue being present on lesson days                           | Because attendance helps us grow and keeps everyone on the same page.         | Batuhan  |
